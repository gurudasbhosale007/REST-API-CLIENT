    The objective of this task was to learn how to handle HTTP requests, retrieve JSON data, parse it, and present it in a user-friendly manner. I chose to work with a weather API, as it provides real-time data that is easy to understand and visualize. The process involved setting up the development environment, integrating an HTTP client in Java, fetching API responses, parsing the JSON data, and displaying it in a meaningful way. This task helped me understand how Java applications interact with web services, a crucial skill for modern software development.
    To begin, I set up my Java development environment with the necessary dependencies. Since Java does not have a built-in HTTP client for handling APIs in a simple way, I decided to use the HttpURLConnection class for basic requests and the org.json library for JSON parsing. Additionally, I used Maven for dependency management, ensuring that my project had all the required libraries. Once my environment was ready, I researched different public APIs and finally selected the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data retrieval. This API provides temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related information in JSON format, which made it a perfect fit for this task.
    The next step was implementing the API request. I wrote a Java program that sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using a city name as a parameter. The API returns a JSON response containing weather details, which I needed to extract and display in a structured manner. To achieve this, I used Java's BufferedReader to read the API response and the org.json library to parse the JSON data efficiently. I extracted relevant details such as the city name, temperature, weather description, and humidity level. After parsing, I formatted the extracted data neatly and printed it to the console for better readability.
