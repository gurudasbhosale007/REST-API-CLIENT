   I worked on developing a client-server chat application using Java sockets and multithreading. This project aimed to establish real-time communication between multiple users while enhancing my understanding of network programming and concurrency in Java. The task required me to implement a server that could handle multiple client connections simultaneously and facilitate message exchange efficiently. Through this assignment, I gained practical experience in designing scalable applications and managing concurrent user interactions, which are essential skills for backend development.
   I started by researching Java socket programming to understand how a client and server communicate over a network. The foundation of the chat application was a server that listens for incoming client connections and a client that connects to the server to exchange messages. Using Java’s ServerSocket class, I implemented the server to continuously listen for client requests. Once a connection was established, the server created a dedicated thread for each client, ensuring that multiple users could send and receive messages concurrently. This multithreading approach prevented blocking, allowing seamless real-time communication.
   Next, I developed the client-side application using Java’s Socket class. The client program established a connection to the server and used an output stream to send messages while reading incoming messages through an input stream. To improve responsiveness, I implemented a separate thread on the client-side to listen for incoming messages, ensuring real-time updates without interfering with user input. This setup allowed users to chat dynamically without having to refresh their screens.
   This project significantly improved my knowledge of network programming, concurrency, and real-time data processing. It provided me with valuable insights into designing scalable communication systems and reinforced my ability to manage multiple user connections effectively. Completing this task boosted my confidence in Java socket programming and strengthened my skills in handling multithreaded applications, making it a crucial step in my growth as a Java developer.
